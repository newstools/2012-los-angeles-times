If you can squeeze in a road trip this month, Budget has a one-way car-rental deal that might work nicely for you. Pick up a car in Arizona, return it to Los Angeles or other California locations at prices that start at $9.95 a day plus tax. The deal: With “Arizona One-Way Savings,” you pick up a rental car in Arizona and travel to selected cities in Arizona, California or Nevada to return it. This makes for a great point-to-point road trip at an inexpensive rate. The price starts at $9.95 a day plus tax (the website lists the cost as $10 a day) for an economy or compact one-way rental up to seven days. This includes unlimited mileage and no drop-off fees. Use the BCD code “D507200" when making a reservation. When: Rental cars must be picked up by June 15 to take advantage of this deal. Tested: I checked availability and the best daily prices for a long trip and a short trip. I found a price of $29.85 plus tax to rent a Hyundai Accent for three days, picking up the rental at Tucson International Airport on June 11 and returning it to LAX on June 14. I also found a price of $97.65 plus tax (or $13.95 per day) for a seven-day rental, picking up and dropping off at the same locations between June 12 and 19. You pay for any extra insurance you may buy (check with your own insurance company to see if you’re covered or with your credit card company) and whatever gas you use along the way. Extra tip: I’ve already written about Hertz $5 a day for one-way rentals from Arizona. That deal is good until June 30. Contact: Budget, (800) 283-4387
